Simple utility "script" that starts an ec2 instance, greps the public DNS name and updates a CNAME subdomain in a route53 zone to point to that dns name.
Can also stop the instance.
It is an alternative to an elastic IP address which is permanently assigned to an instance.

The instance itself must be marked with a tag which is configured in the applications.conf (as also the credentials, the hosted zone id and the subdomain)

I use this script to start my preconfigued VPN instance and update the vpn record of my domain to point to it.
It is quickly thrown together and misses on error checking and recovery.

It is started with: sbt "run start" 
soptted with: sbt "run stop"
